    <h1>Game Idea: XO Advanced</h1>
    <h2>General Description:</h2>
    <h3>The game is a smart and fun development of the classic XO game.</h3>
    <h3>It is played on a large board (a big XO) divided into 9 squares, each of which contains a small XO game on its own.</h3>
    <h2>How to Play?</h2>
    <h3>1. The first player (X) chooses any of the 9 squares (any small XO) and places their mark (X) in one of the cells inside it.</h3>
    <h3>2. The second player (O) doesn't get to choose freely where to play, but:</h3>
    <p>The small square (small XO) where the first player placed their mark determines the next big square to play in.</p>
    <p>Example: If X plays in the top-right cell of a small XO, player O must play in the top-right big XO.</p>
    <h3>3. If the square they are supposed to play in is closed (already won or tied), the player is free to choose any small XO they want.</h3>
    <h3>4. The Goal:</h3>
    <p>Win a small XO by placing 3 consecutive marks (X or O).</p>
    <p>When you win a small XO, it counts as if you have claimed a cell in the big XO.</p>
    <p>To win the game, you need to claim 3 consecutive small XOs (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in the big XO.</p>
    <h2>Main Features of the Game:</h2>
    <h3>Strategic thinking: You need to plan not only where to place your mark but also where to send your opponent to play.</h3>
    <h3>The game teaches forward planning and control over the game's flow.</h3>
    <h3>Interactive design that is simple yet highly challenging.</h3>
    <h3>You can play against a friend or against AI.</h3>
    <h2>Example for Clarification:</h2>
    <h3>X played in the middle small XO and chose the left cell.</h3>
    <h3>O must now play in the big XO on the left.</h3>
    <h3>O placed their mark in the left big XO, in the top-right cell.</h3>
    <h3>Now X must play in the big XO at the top-right... and so on.</h3>
